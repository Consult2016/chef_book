\section{Installation}

Exists several ways to install own Chef Server:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Go to \href{http://www.getchef.com/chef/install/}{www.getchef.com/chef/install}, select the operating system, version, and architecture of the server and install the downloaded package on it. After installation you can configure server by command <<sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure>>
  \item Use Chef Solo to install Chef Server
\end{itemize}

Of course, I prefer to use Chef Solo to install and configure Chef Server.
