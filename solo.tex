\chapter{Chef Solo}

Chef Solo is simple way to begin working with Chef. It is an open source version of the chef-client that allows using cookbooks with nodes without requiring access to a server. Chef Solo runs locally and requires that a cookbook (and any of its dependencies) be on the same physical disk as the node. It is a limited-functionality version of the chef-client and does not support the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Node data storage
  \item Search indexes
  \item Centralized distribution of cookbooks
  \item A centralized API that interacts with and integrates infrastructure components
  \item Authentication or authorization
  \item Persistent attributes
\end{itemize}
