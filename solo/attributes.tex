\section{Attributes}

An attribute is a specific detail about a node. Attributes are used by the chef-client to understand:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The current state of the node
  \item What the state of the node was at the end of the previous chef-client run
  \item What the state of the node should be at the end of the current chef-client run
\end{itemize}

As you read from previous sections of book, attributes can be defined in node and role, but it's also can be defined by environments and cookbooks.
