\section{Vendor cookbooks and berkshelf}
\label{sec:solo-berkshelf}

Suppose, that our task to install Apache2 on node. For this purpose we can use vendor cookbook through berkshelf. Huge amount cookbooks you can find at \href{http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks}{Chef community website}. To install Apache2 cookbook we need add it to Berksfile:

\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:my-cloud-berkshelf1,title=my-cloud/Berksfile]
source "http://api.berkshelf.com"

cookbook 'apache2'
\end{lstlisting}

After running the command \inline{berks install} this cookbook will be installed with dependencies.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,label=lst:my-cloud-berkshelf2]
$ berks install
Using apache2 (1.7.0)
\end{lstlisting}

By default, you will not find this cookbook in <<cookbooks>> directory. Berkshelf install cookbooks in <<~/.berkshelf>> directory (to avoid duplication of cookbooks, if you have several chef-repo). To install it in special path you can use \inline{--path} option:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,label=lst:my-cloud-berkshelf3]
$ berks install --path cookbooks
Using apache2 (1.7.0)
$ ls cookbooks
apache2
\end{lstlisting}

Option \inline{knife[:berkshelf_path]} in knife.rb file set to install our cookbooks into cookbooks directory. In this case no need to run \inline{berks install --path cookbooks} each time, when you need <<cook>> a node - knife-solo will do it automatically.

Now we can start to work with a nodes.
