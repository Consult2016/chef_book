\section{.Chef folder}

After creating the kitchen you should find the <<.chef>> directory. The <<.chef>> directory will contain the configuration and credentials it use knife, the command line interface for Chef.

For Chef Solo in this directory mostly contained only knife.rb file. A knife.rb file is used to specify the chef-repo-specific configuration details for Knife. This file is the default configuration file and is loaded every time this executable is run. The configuration file is located at: <<~/.chef/knife.rb>>. If a knife.rb file is present in the .chef/knife.rb directory in the chef-repo, the settings contained within that file will override the default configuration settings.

My knife.rb have such content:

\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:my-cloud-chef-filder1,title=my-cloud/.chef/knife.rb]
cookbook_path    ["cookbooks", "site-cookbooks"]
node_path        "nodes"
role_path        "roles"
environment_path "environments"
data_bag_path    "data_bags"
#encrypted_data_bag_secret "data_bag_key"

knife[:berkshelf_path] = "cookbooks"
\end{lstlisting}

Options:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{cookbook\_path} - the sub-directory for cookbooks on the chef-client
  \item \textbf{node\_path} - the sub-directory for nodes on the chef-client
  \item \textbf{role\_path} - the sub-directory for roles on the chef-client
  \item \textbf{environment\_path} - the sub-directory for environments on the chef-client
  \item \textbf{data\_bag\_path} - the sub-directory for Data Bags on the chef-client
  \item \textbf{knife[:berkshelf\_path]} - as you remember, knife-solo gem have integration with Berkshelf and Librarian-Chef. By this option we set directory in which knife will install vendor cookbooks from Berksfile before cook node
\end{itemize}
