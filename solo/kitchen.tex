\section{Creation of kitchen (chef-repo)}
\label{sec:solo-kitchen}

Working with Chef Solo starts with creating kitchen (chef-repo). The kitchen is located on a workstation (location from which most users will do most of their work, ie. your computer) and should be synchronized with a version control system. To create a kitchen used knife-solo rubygems:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,label=lst:my-cloud-kitchen1,title=my-cloud]
$ cd my-cloud
$ knife solo init .

\end{lstlisting}

Let's consider a directory structure:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \inline{cookbooks} - directory for Chef cookbooks. This directory will be used for vendor cookbooks, that will be installed with the help of berkshelf
  \item \inline{data_bags} - directory for Chef Data Bags
  \item \inline{environments} - directory for Chef environments
  \item \inline{nodes} - directory for Chef nodes
  \item \inline{roles} - directory for Chef roles
  \item \inline{site-cookbooks} - directory for your custom Chef cookbooks
  \item \inline{Berksfile} - file contains a list of sources identifying what cookbooks to retrieve and where to get them for berkshelf
\end{itemize}

Cookbooks directory added into <<.gitignore>>, because it contains only vendor cookbooks. Need to remember about it when using other version control system.
