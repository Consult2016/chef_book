\label{sec:testing-cucumber-spec}

\href{http://cukes.info/}{Cucumber} is a tool for running automated tests written in plain language. Because they're written in plain language, they can be read by anyone on your team. Because they can be read by anyone, you can use them to help improve communication, collaboration and trust on your team.

$ cucumber
Feature: Customer can use my cool web app

  In order to get more payment customers
  As a business owner
  I want web users to be able use my cool web app

  Background:                                              # features/working_web_page.feature:7
    Given I have provisioned the following infrastructure: # features/working_web_page.feature:8
      | Server Name | Operating System | Version | Chef Version | Run List             |
      | localhost   | ubuntu           | 12.04   | 11.4.4       | my_cool_app::default |
    And I have run Chef                                    # features/working_web_page.feature:12

  Scenario: User visits home page                          # features/working_web_page.feature:14
    Given a url http://leibniz-localhost                   # features/working_web_page.feature:15
    When a web user browses to the URL                     # features/working_web_page.feature:16
    Then the user should see "This is my cool web app"     # features/working_web_page.feature:17

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given(/^I have provisioned the following infrastructure:$/) do |table|
  # table is a Cucumber::Ast::Table
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given(/^I have run Chef$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given(/^a url http:\/\/leibniz-localhost$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When(/^a web user browses to the URL$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then(/^the user should see "(.*?)"$/) do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

If you want snippets in a different programming language,
just make sure a file with the appropriate file extension
exists where cucumber looks for step definitions.
