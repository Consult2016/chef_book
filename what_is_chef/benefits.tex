\section{Why you should use Chef?}
\label{sec:what-benefits}

There are several reasons for using Chef:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Efficiency:} It's more effective to use Chef, which will contain all your servers configuration in one place
  \item \textbf{Scalability:} Do you need scale you app? Split your server into cloud (several servers) by using environments, roles and nodes
  \item \textbf{Reusing and Save money:} No need 10 times install a same software for your application on server. Just create new node in Chef and after several minutes you will have configured instance
  \item \textbf{Documentation:} You Chef is also documentation for your cloud, because Chef recipes contain all information about your environment
\end{itemize}

And of course the main point is shown on picture~\ref{fig:automate-all-the-things}.
