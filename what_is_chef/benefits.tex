\section{Why you should use Chef?}
\label{sec:what-benefits}

There are several reasons for using Chef:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Efficiency:} It's more effective to use Chef, which will contain all your servers configuration in one place
  \item \textbf{Scalability:} Do you need to scale your app? Split your server into several cloud servers, by using environments, roles and nodes
  \item \textbf{Reusing and Save money:} No need to install the same software 10 times for your application on the server. Just create a new node in Chef and after several minutes you will have configured the instance
  \item \textbf{Documentation:} Chef is also documentation for your cloud, because Chef recipes contain all the configuration information for your environment
\end{itemize}

And of course the main point is shown on picture~\ref{fig:automate-all-the-things}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item <<Magically>> configure your server

  \item Monitor your servers or software
  \item Undoing concept
\end{itemize}
