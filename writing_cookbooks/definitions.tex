\section{Definitions}

A definition is used to declare resources so they can be added to the resource collection. A definition is not a resource or a lightweight resource. A definition does not have an associated provider. A definition groups two (or more) resource declarations. There is no limit to the number of resources that can be part of a definition. All definitions within a cookbook must be located in the definitions/ folder. A definition is never declared into a cookbook. A definition is best-used when:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Data needs to be passed from one (or more) recipes into a single definition
  \item A repeating usage pattern exists for one (or more) resources
  \item An action does not need to be sent directly to a resource (when it does, it should be sent to a provider)
\end{itemize}
