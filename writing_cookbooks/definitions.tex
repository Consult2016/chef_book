\section{Definitions}

A definition is used to declare resources so they can be added to the resource collection. A definition is not a resource or a lightweight resource. A definition does not have an associated provider. A definition groups two (or more) resource declarations. There is no limit to the number of resources that can be part of a definition. All definitions within a cookbook must be located in the <<definitions/>> folder. A definition is never declared into a cookbook. A definition is best-used when:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Data needs to be passed from one (or more) recipes into a single definition
  \item A repeating usage pattern exists for one (or more) resources
  \item An action does not need to be sent directly to a resource (when it does, it should be sent to a provider)
\end{itemize}

In our \inline{my_cool_app} cookbook we are using \inline{nginx_site} definition from nginx cookbook.

\subsection{Example}

Let's create definition in our \inline{my_cool_app} cookbook. We will move our nginx conf creation into definition.

\lstinputlisting[label=lst:cookbook-definitions-default1,title=my-server-cloud/site-cookbooks/my\_cool\_app/recipes/default.rb]{code/book/cookbook/definitions/default_before.rb}

To definition \inline{enable_web_site}:

\lstinputlisting[label=lst:cookbook-definitions-enable-site,title=my-server-cloud/site-cookbooks/my\_cool\_app/definitions/enable\_web\_site.rb]{code/book/cookbook/definitions/enable_web_site.rb}

And now we can replace code in~\ref{lst:cookbook-definitions1} by this code:

\lstinputlisting[label=lst:cookbook-definitions-default2,title=my-server-cloud/site-cookbooks/my\_cool\_app/recipes/default.rb]{code/book/cookbook/definitions/default_after.rb}

And check how it works:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,label=lst:cookbook-definitions-shell1]
$ knife cookbook upload my_cool_app
Uploading my_cool_app    [0.1.0]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.

$ vagrant provision chef_second_client
...
INFO: template[/etc/nginx/sites-available/my_cool_app.conf] created file /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_cool_app.conf
INFO: template[/etc/nginx/sites-available/my_cool_app.conf] updated file contents /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_cool_app.conf
INFO: template[/etc/nginx/sites-available/my_cool_app.conf] mode changed to 644
INFO: execute[nxensite my_cool_app.conf] ran successfully
...
\end{lstlisting}

As you can see our definition is works as expected.
